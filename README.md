To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the charity.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
Upload all files on your server except for charirt.sql!
The admin user which I have made has an email id charitycampus786@gmail.com and the password is Charity@2020. (Please confirm this in db or create one manually.
Open HOME.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database. Now re-upload this file to the server.
